# Contribution

If you would like to contribute to the development of Kryptoxin, feel free to create [pull requests](https://github.com/e3prom/kryptoxin/pulls). We welcome any contributions, ranging from code improvements to templates.

## Templates submission guidelines

We only accept security templates as contribution if the below conditions are met:

 1. The code is not damaging or negatively impacting the systems where they are running (e,g. opening vulnerabilities).
 2. The template should not include code or instructions allowing for the bypassing of current version of Windows Defender.
 3. The script or program must not exfiltrate or leak any sensitive information from the running host (e,g. NTLM hashes).
