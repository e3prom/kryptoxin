# Welcome to the Kryptoxin documentation

## Overview

Kryptoxin is a Python tool allowing you to quickly and easily generate encrypted payloads. It supports various object types and various programming languages. This software is intended for use in the security field for storing encrypted objects on target hosts. It can also be used for concealing scripts and binary objects from scrutiny.

The name `Kryptoxin` comes from the contraction of `Kryptos` (meaning `conceal`, `hidden` or `secret` in Greek) and the word `Toxin` (meaning `poison`). As the name implies, the intended goal of this project is to provide a fast and efficient way of concealing or hiding payloads such as implants, thus avoiding AV and EDR detection. Most of our templates are "living off the land", using libraries and encryption routines commonly found in base operating systems installations.
