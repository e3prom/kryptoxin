# Welcome to the Kryptoxin documentation

## Overview

Kryptoxin is a Python tool allowing you to generate encrypted payloads effortlessly. This software is primarily intended for use in the security field for storing encrypted objects on target hosts. It can also be used for concealing scripts and binary objects from scrutiny. It supports various object types, programming languages and frameworks such as `PowerShell`, `C#`, `VBA Macro` and `.NET`.

The name `Kryptoxin` comes from the contraction of `Kryptos` (meaning `conceal`, `hidden` or `secret` in Greek) and the word `Toxin` (meaning `poison`). As the name implies, the intended goal of this project is to provide a fast and efficient way of concealing or hiding payloads, thus saving you a lot of time and effort. Most of our templates are "living off the land", using system libraries and encryption routines commonly found in base operating systems installations.
